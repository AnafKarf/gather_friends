# How to organize a meeting with friends

## Why you need to read this instruction

People often have different schedules and interests. 
Organizing a meeting with everyone you want to be there is challenging.
This instruction proposes common advice on how to organize such event smoothly.

## Organize meeting in advance

### Step 1. Who you want to invite?

Define what people you want to invite to the meeting.
Create a group in a messanger with all the people involved to simplify the organization process.

### Step 2. What do you want to do?

Suggest a reason for the meeting. 
The initial idea may be vague, for example "board games" or "go to a cafe". 
However, such suggestion will start a discussion, involving more people into the organization process.

### Step 3. When will the meeting be?

Find a time for a meeting comfortable for everyone. 
This can be done with polls or via special services, such as [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/).
Pick a time when all people you want to attend are available.
If no time slot suits everyone, either postpone the meeting or organize two meetings for different subsets of your friend group.

### Step 4. Where will you go?

Find a place for your meeting. 
Make sure this place is suitable for the type of activities you have planned.
Also give everyone clear instructions on how to get there.

### Step 5. What will you take with you?

Tell everyone what they should bring to the meeting, based on what activities you have planned.
Try to distribute heavy or bulky items between different people, so that no one will get overloaded.

### Step 6. Does everyone remember about the meeting?

Make frequent reminders about the meeting. 
Ask everyone if they are still available a day before, and make changes to the organization process if needed.

## Organize meeting on the fly

### Step 1. Notify everyone about the meeting

Make sure everyone you want to come knows about the meeting. 
Write them in a messanger or, preferably, tell them in person, if they are nearby.

### Step 2. Be mindful of time constraints

Ask everyone when they have to leave.
Try to finish the meeting before that time or allow person to leave when they need to.

### Step 3. Come ot terms with the fact not everyone will come

People may already be occupied.
Do not make people come if they are unavailable.

## Common advice for organizers

1. Do not be the only one who proposes meetings. Sometimes you have to let other people be the initiators.
2. Try to find activities for everyone. No one will like a meeting when they just watch others do something fub, unable to participate.
3. Think about the food. If the meeting will take a long time, plan the meal break in advance.

## Final note

The most important point of meeting with friends is to have fun.
Do not get stressed while preparing it. 
At the end of the day, you also should be able to enjoy the meeting!
